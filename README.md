# ksm-validator-crowdfunding

## Concept

Our observation...... 

the most important thing is to get to the top of "Target" which is a hard thing to do while 1kv stash tends to over-nominating
1kv stash sometimes nominate you but the stash did not distribute to you by the phragmen.

## Plan

currently, you need about 4000 ksm to become active. we suggest that by gathering 80 operators within one 1kv program, we can make one validator active while make sure it in the top of the Target page.

### Shortcoming

1. while we gather 80 operators, most of them needs to wait for a long time to be nominated by the stash.
2. those who is nominated and can run independently could withdraw from the project.

## Solution
